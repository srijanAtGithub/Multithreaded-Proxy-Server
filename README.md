I developed a sophisticated proxy server system designed to efficiently manage multiple concurrent HTTP client requests. 

The architecture employed semaphore locks and a custom HTTP parser to effectively control request handling. 

To optimize performance and prevent race conditions, I implemented a caching system using a combination of LRU (Least Recently Used) caching strategy, Redis for data storage, and linked list data structures, all working seamlessly in a multithreaded environment. 

The system successfully achieved parallel processing of client requests on multiprocessor systems, demonstrating robust concurrency handling. 

This project significantly enhanced my expertise in Java development, computer networking principles, socket programming, multithreading concepts, and Redis implementation, while providing practical experience in building high-performance distributed systems.
